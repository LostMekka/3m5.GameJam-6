### Gameplay
- Hover over any tile with the mouse to see a description of what it is.
- On each floor is a portal that leads to the next floor.
- Activating all altars activates the portal.
- Activating an altar costs torches, but slightly boosts your health.
- Madness spreads in the dark. Light up areas by placing torches. Torches can be snuffed out by the madness if placed too close.
- Pick up unlit torches so your supply does not run out, or pick up placed torches to relocate them.
- With a torch equipped, you light up the surrounding area and can place torches or activate altars.
- With your sword equipped, you can fight by walking into enemies, but you won't light up your surroundings.
- Travelling through a portal resets your health and torch supply.
